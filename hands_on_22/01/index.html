      <h2>Radon is a cancer-causing, radioactive gas</h2>
      <p>You can't see radon. You can't smell radon. You can't taste radon. But radon may be a problem in your home. Radon causes thousands of deaths each year. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in
        the United States. Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Radon can be found all over the U.S.</h2>
      <p>Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water and gets into the air you breathe. Radon can be found all over the U.S. and can get into any type of building â€” homes, offices, and schools. You and
        your family are most likely to get your greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your time.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>You should test for radon</h2>
      <p>Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from radon. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes. Testing is inexpensive and easy. It will only take a few minutes of your time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>You can fix a radon problem</h2>
      <p>Radon reduction systems work and they are not too costly. Some radon reduction systems can reduce radon levels in your home by up to 99%. Even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How does radon get into your home?</h2>
      <p>Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the ground and into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Your home traps radon
        inside where it can build up. Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.</p>

    <section id="rdn-ways">
      <h2>Radon gets in through:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Cracks in solid floors</li>
        <li>Construction joints</li>
        <li>Cracks in walls</li>
        <li>Gaps in suspended floors</li>
        <li>Gaps around service pipes</li>

      <h2>Test Today</h2>
      <p>Nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is estimated to have elevated radon levels. Elevated levels of radon gas have been found in homes in Fresno, Clovis, surrounding San Joaquin Valley homes, and in homes in the Sierra Mountains. While
        radon problems may be more common in some areas, any home may have a problem. The only way to know about your home is to test.</p>

    <h1>TESTING FOR RADON</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>The EPA And the Surgeon General recommend testing for radon
      </h2>
      <p>Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from radon. Testing is inexpensive and easy. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend that you test your home for radon. Millions of Americans have already tested their
        homes for radon. Keep yourself and your family safe. Test today.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>The testing process</h2>
      <p>Testing your home for radon is easy. Simply call us and book an appointment. The appointment will take place at your house. One of our technicians will come to your home and install testing equipment. The equipment is small and quiet. The
        equipment will be placed in an unobtrusive location. Setting up the equipment only takes a few minutes. After two days, our technician will come back to your house, pick up the equipment, interpret your results, answer questions, and provide
        solutions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Testing fees</h2>
      <p>Testing your home for radon is very affordable. The fee for testing is normally $250 but we are offering a special promotion through the end of the month which offers testing for only $99.</p>

      <h2>Radon measurement</h2>
      <p>Radon is measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L). If your radon level is 4 pCi/L or higher, the EPA and the Surgeon General recommend that you fix your home. Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L still poses a risk which, in many cases, may be
        reduced. The EPA believes that any radon exposure carries risk - no level of radon is safe. Even radon levels below 4 pCi/L pose some risk, and you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by lowering your radon level.</p>
      <p>The average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi/L. About 0.4 pCi/L of radon is normally found in the outside air. The U.S. Congress has set a long-term goal that indoor radon levels be no more than outdoor levels. While this
        goal is not yet achievable in all cases, most homes today can be reduced to 2 pCi/L or below.</p>

      <h2>Radon and selling your home</h2>
      <p>More home buyers and renters are asking about radon levels before they buy or rent a home. Because real estate sales happen quickly, there is often little time to deal with radon and other issues. The best thing to do is to test for radon
        now and save the results so that you may share them with the buyer. If your home has elevated radon levels, fix the problem now so that it won't complicate your home sale.</p>

      <h2>How to lower radon levels in your home</h2>
      <p>There is no known safe level of radon. You can reduce your risk by decreasing radon levels in your home.</p>
      <p>There are several proven methods to reduce radon in your home. The method primarily used is a vent pipe and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside. This system, known as a soil suction radon reduction
        system, does not require major changes to your home. Sealing foundation cracks and other openings makes this kind of system more effective and cost-efficient. Similar systems can be installed in houses with crawl spaces. Our licensed
        contractors might use other methods. The right system depends on the design of your home.</p>
      <p>Lowering high radon levels requires technical knowledge and special skills. Our contractors are licensed and trained to fix radon problems. We will study the radon problem in your home and find the best solution for lowering radon levels in
        your home.</p>
      <p>After we have installed a system for lowering radon levels in your home, we will test your home again to ensure that radon levels have been reduced to a safe level. Our soil suction radon reduction systems also include a monitor that will
        indicate whether the system is operating properly.</p>

      <h2>Radon and home renovations</h2>
      <p>If you are planning a remodel, it is important to test the area for radon before you begin. If you have elevated radon levels, radon-resistant techniques can be inexpensively included as part of the remodel. Because major renovations can
        change the level of radon in any home, always test again after work is completed. Contact us so that we may help you make your home a safe and healthy place to live.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Our company, our family</h2>
        <p>We are a local, family-run business. We began this business because we became aware of the cancer-causing hazard that radon poses. After our son was born, I learned that children are particularly susceptible to the negative health impacts of radon. At the time there was no local business that provided radon testing or mitigation. In order to keep our family safe, we educated ourselves. We learned how to test for radon and how to reduce radon levels. The first radon mitigation system we installed was in our home. I am happy that our home is now free from the unnecessary danger of hazardously high radon levels.</p>
        <p>Helping people stay safe, helping people protect their families, and helping people avoid cancer is what our business is all about. As we talked to friends and family about radon, we realized there are many people who can benefit from what we have learned. We partnered with our cousin who is a licensed general contractor and our business was born.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to help people stay healthy so that they can live and enjoy their lives.</p>
